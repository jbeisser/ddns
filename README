The Less Than Simple DynDNS Update client.

It does one thing, and does it decently enough: updates DynDNS with a specific
interface's IP address.

It does not:
    - try to log in to a router for you
    - attempt to handle logins for a web form

It does:
    - "just work" for OpenBSD 4.5
    - get and parse the interface's IP (via ifconfig(8))
    - work via a simple config file
    - use HTTPS, with authentication to the remote side.

It's not intended to be anything complicated or solve more than the simplest of
problems: updating a set of hostnames for a single IP address.

It's verified to work with all DynDNS domains and hosted DNS domains.

TODO:
    - support Linux's ifconfig(8)/ip(8) tools (by platform)
    - Log failures, successes, etc
    - error handling would be nice.
